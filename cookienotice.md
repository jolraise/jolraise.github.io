## Web Beacons

As well as cookies, we use other technologies to recognize and track visitors to our Services. 
A web beacon (also known as a “tracking pixel” or “clear GIF”) is a clear graphic image (typically a one-pixel tag) 
that is delivered through a web browser or HTML e-mail, typically in conjunction with a cookie.


Web beacons allows us, for example, to monitor how users move from one page within our Services to another, 
to track access to our communications, to understand whether users have come to our Services from an 
online advertisement displayed on a third-party website, to measure how ads have been viewed and to 
improve Services performance.


## Targeted Advertising

We do not actively share your personal information with third party advertisers for their marketing purposes unless 
you give us your consent. When advertisers or ad networks place ads in our Services, they may collect, 
or we may share the following information from within our Services:
* performance data (like the number of clicks on an advertisement);
* aggregated and/or de-identified information about you or other players collectively not intended to personally identify you;
* certain technical information (such as IP address, non-persistent device identifiers like IDFAs, 
  and de-identified persistent device identifier like a hashed Android ID); and/or
* Other contextual data about your game play (e.g. your level and session length)


The information collected may be used to measure the effectiveness of the ads, offer targeting advertising, 
and/or undertake web analytics (like Google analytics).


Advertisers and ad networks may collect this information through the use of tracking technologies, and they may share 
this information with their customers and clients. Please note, after clicking on a third-party ad you may no longer 
be on a site hosted by jolraise. Our Privacy Policy and this Cookie Notice does not apply to, and 
jolraise is not responsible for, third party cookies, web beacons or other tracking technologies. 
We are not responsible for the actions of those companies, the content of their products or services, 
the use of the information you provide them, or any products or services they may offer.
