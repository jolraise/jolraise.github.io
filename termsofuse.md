# Terms Of Use


Last updated July 14, 2021


You can find our Privacy Policy here: [Privacy Policy](https://jolraise.com/privacypolicy)


jolraise Ltd (as "jolraise", "we" or "us") develops and publishes games and applications for mobile devices.  
This Agreement requires the use of arbitration on an individual basis to resolve disputes, rather than 
jury trials or class actions, and also limits the remedies available to you in the event of a dispute.


This Terms of Service ("Agreement") sets forth the legally binding terms for your use of any App 
(including any related services provided by jolraise). By using any App, you are accepting this Agreement 
and you represent and warrant that you have the right, authority, and capacity to enter into this Agreement. 
If you do not agree with all of the provisions of this Agreement, please do not use any App. 
This Agreement is the final, complete and exclusive agreement of you and jolraise with respect to the subject 
matters hereof (including the Apps) and supersedes and merges all prior discussions and agreements between the 
parties with respect to such subject matters (including any prior End User License Agreements, 
Terms of Service or Privacy Policy).


By downloading or using any app, these terms will automatically apply to you - you should make sure therefore 
that you read them carefully before using any app developed by jolraise. You are not allowed to copy, or modify the app, 
any part of the app, or our trademarks in any way. You are not allowed to attempt to extract the source code 
of the app, and you also should not try to translate the app into other languages, or make derivative versions. 
The app itself, and all the trade marks, copyright, database rights and other intellectual property rights related to it, 
still belong to jolraise Ltd.


jolraise Ltd is committed to ensuring that the app is as useful and efficient as possible. 
For that reason, we reserve the right to make changes to the app or to charge for its services, at any time and for any reason. 
We will never charge you for the app or its services without making it very clear to you exactly what you are paying for.


The app stores and processes personal data that you have provided to us, in order to provide our Service. 
It's your responsibility to keep your phone and access to the app secure. We therefore recommend that you do not 
jailbreak or root your phone, which is the process of removing software restrictions and limitations imposed by 
the official operating system of your device. It could make your phone vulnerable to malware/viruses/malicious programs, 
compromise your phone's security features and it could mean that the App won't work properly or at all.


## End User License Agreement

THE GAME SOFTWARE IS LICENSED - NOT SOLD.

Subject to your compliance with this Agreement, we hereby grant you a non-exclusive, non-transferable right

### Ownership
Except for the license we grant you in section 'Limited Use License', all right, title, and interest in

are owned by jolraise or our licensors. This Agreement is not a sale and does not convey to you any rights 
of ownership in or related to any App. The jolraise name, logo, and the product names associated with the Apps 
belong to jolraise (or its licensors, where applicable), and no right or license is granted to use them by implication, 
estoppel or otherwise. jolraise (and its licensors, where applicable) reserve all rights not granted in this Agreement.


### Links
The Game Software may contain links to other websites and online resources. A link to a third party's website 
does not mean that we endorse it or that we are affiliated with it. We are not responsible or liable for any damage 
or loss related to the use of any third-party website. You should always read the terms and conditions and 
privacy policy of a third-party website before using it.
